https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.0/release-notes-8.0.0.html[here].

[discrete]
===== Drop old typescript definitions

*Breaking: Yes* | *Migration effort: Medium*

The current TypeScript definitions will be removed from the client, and the new definitions, which contain request and response definitions as well will be shipped by default.

[discrete]
===== Drop callback-style API

*Breaking: Yes* | *Migration effort: Large*

Maintaining both API styles is not a problem per se, but it makes error handling more convoluted due to async stack traces.
Moving to a full-promise API will solve this issue.

[source,js]
----
// callback-style api
client.search({ params }, { options }, (err, result) => {
 console.log(err || result)
})

// promise-style api
client.search({ params }, { options })
  .then(console.log)
  .catch(console.log)
  
// async-style (sugar syntax on top of promises)
const response = await client.search({ params }, { options })
console.log(response)
----

If you are already using the promise-style API, this won't be a breaking change for you.

[discrete]
===== Remove the current abort API and use the new AbortController standard

*Breaking: Yes* | *Migration effort: Small*

The old abort API makes sense for callbacks but it's annoying to use with promises

[source,js]
----
// callback-style api
const request = client.search({ params }, { options }, (err, result) => {
 console.log(err) // RequestAbortedError
})

request.abort()

// promise-style api
const promise = client.search({ params }, { options })

promise
  .then(console.log)
  .catch(console.log) // RequestAbortedError

promise.abort()
----

Node v12 has added the standard https://nodejs.org/api/globals.html#globals_class_abortcontroller[`AbortController`] API which is designed to work well with both callbacks and promises.
[source,js]
----
const ac = new AbortController()
client.search({ params }, { signal: ac.signal })
  .then(console.log)
  .catch(console.log) // RequestAbortedError

ac.abort()
----

[discrete]
===== Remove the body key from the request

*Breaking: Yes* | *Migration effort: Small*

Thanks to the new types we are developing now we know exactly where a parameter should go.
The client API leaks HTTP-related notions in many places, and removing them would definitely improve the DX.

This could be a rather big breaking change, so a double solution could be used during the 8.x lifecycle. (accepting body keys without them being wrapped in the body as well as the current solution).

[source,js]
----
// from
const response = await client.search({
  index: 'test',
  body: {
    query: {
      match_all: {}
    }
  }
})

// to
const response = await client.search({
  index: 'test',
  query: {
    match_all: {}
  }
})
----

[discrete]
===== Migrate to new separate transport

*Breaking: Yes* | *Migration effort: Small to none*

The separated transport has been rewritten in TypeScript and has already dropped the callback style API.
Given that now is separated, most of the Elasticsearch specific concepts have been removed, and the client will likely need to extend parts of it for reintroducing them.
If you weren't extending the internals of the client, this won't be a breaking change for you.

[discrete]
===== The returned value of API calls is the body and not the HTTP related keys

*Breaking: Yes* | *Migration effort: Small*

The client API leaks HTTP-related notions in many places, and removing them would definitely improve the DX.
The client will expose a new request-specific option to still get the full response details.

[source,js]
----
// from
const response = await client.search({
  index: 'test',
  body: {
    query: {
      match_all: {}
    }
  }
})
console.log(response) // { body: SearchResponse, statusCode: number, headers: object, warnings: array }

// to
const response = await client.search({
  index: 'test',
  query: {
    match_all: {}
  }
})
console.log(response) // SearchResponse

// with a bit of TypeScript and JavaScript magic...
const response = await client.search({
  index: 'test',
  query: {
    match_all: {}
  }
}, {
  meta: true
})
console.log(response) // { body: SearchResponse, statusCode: number, headers: object, warnings: array }
----

[discrete]
===== Use a weighted connection pool

*Breaking: Yes* | *Migration effort: Small to none*

Move from the current cluster connection pool to a weight-based implementation.
This new implementation offers better performances and runs less code in the background, the old connection pool can still be used.
If you weren't extending the internals of the client, this won't be a breaking change for you.

[discrete]
===== Migrate to the "undici" http client

*Breaking: Yes* | *Migration effort: Small to none*

By default, the HTTP client will no longer be the default Node.js HTTP client, but https://github.com/nodejs/undici[undici] instead.
Undici is a brand new HTTP client written from scratch, it offers vastly improved performances and has better support for promises.
Furthermore, it offers comprehensive and predictable error handling. The old HTTP client can still be used.
If you weren't extending the internals of the client, this won't be a breaking change for you.

[discrete]
===== Drop support for old camelCased keys

*Breaking: Yes* | *Migration effort: Medium*

Currently, every path or query parameter could be expressed in both `snake_case` and `camelCase`. Internally the client will convert everything to `snake_case`. 
This was done in an effort to reduce the friction of migrating from the legacy to the new client, but now it no longer makes sense.
If you are already using `snake_case` keys, this won't be a breaking change for you.

[discrete]
===== Rename `ssl` option to `tls`

*Breaking: Yes* | *Migration effort: Small*

People usually refers to this as `tls`, furthermore, internally we use the tls API and Node.js refers to it as tls everywhere.
[source,js]
----
// before
const client = new Client({
  node: 'https://localhost:9200',
  ssl: {
    rejectUnauthorized: false
  }
})

// after
const client = new Client({
  node: 'https://localhost:9200',
  tls: {
    rejectUnauthorized: false
  }
})
----

[discrete]
===== Remove prototype poisoning protection

*Breaking: Yes* | *Migration effort: Small*

Prototype poisoning protection is very useful, but it can cause performances issues with big payloads.
In v8 it will be removed, and the documentation will show how to add it back with a custom serializer.

[discrete]
===== Remove client extensions API

*Breaking: Yes* | *Migration effort: Large*

Nowadays the client support the entire Elasticsearch API, and the `transport.request` method can be used if necessary. The client extensions API have no reason to exist.
[source,js]
----
client.extend('utility.index', ({ makeRequest }) => {
  return function _index (params, options) {
    // your code
  }
})

client.utility.index(...)
----

If you weren't using client extensions, this won't be a breaking change for you.

[discrete]
===== Move to TypeScript

*Breaking: No* | *Migration effort: None*

The new separated transport is already written in TypeScript, and it makes sense that the client v8 will be fully written in TypeScript as well.

[discrete]
===== Move from emitter-like interface to a diagnostic method

*Breaking: Yes* | *Migration effort: Small*

Currently, the client offers a subset of methods of the `EventEmitter` class, v8 will ship with a `diagnostic` property which will be a proper event emitter.
[source,js]
----
// from
client.on('request', console.log)

// to
client.diagnostic.on('request', console.log)
----

[discrete]
===== Remove username & password properties from Cloud configuration

*Breaking: Yes* | *Migration effort: Small*

The Cloud configuration does not support ApiKey and Bearer auth, while the `auth` options does.
There is no need to keep the legacy basic auth support in the cloud configuration.
[source,js]
----
// before
const client = new Client({
  cloud: {
    id: '<cloud-id>',
    username: 'elastic',
    password: 'changeme'
  }
})

// after
const client = new Client({
  cloud: {
    id: '<cloud-id>'
  },
  auth: {
    username: 'elastic',
    password: 'changeme'
  }
})
----

If you are already passing the basic auth options in the `auth` configuration, this won't be a breaking change for you.

[discrete]
===== Calling `client.close` will reject new requests

Once you call `client.close` every new request after that will be rejected with a `NoLivingConnectionsError`. In-flight requests will be executed normally unless an in-flight request requires a retry, in which case it will be rejected.

[discrete]
===== Parameters rename

- `ilm.delete_lifecycle`: `policy` parameter has been renamed to `name`
- `ilm.get_lifecycle`: `policy` parameter has been renamed to `name`
- `ilm.put_lifecycle`: `policy` parameter has been renamed to `name`
- `snapshot.cleanup_repository`: `repository` parameter has been renamed to `name`
- `snapshot.create_repository`: `repository` parameter has been renamed to `name`
- `snapshot.delete_repository`: `repository` parameter has been renamed to `name`
- `snapshot.get_repository`: `repository` parameter has been renamed to `name`
- `snapshot.verify_repository`: `repository` parameter has been renamed to `name`

[discrete]
===== Removal of snake_cased methods

The v7 client provided snake_cased methods, such as `client.delete_by_query`. This is no longer supported, now only camelCased method are present.
So `client.delete_by_query` can be accessed with `client.deleteByQuery`
