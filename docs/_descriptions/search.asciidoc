Return documents matching a query, aggregations/facets, highlighted snippets, suggestions, and more. Write your queries as either http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-uri-request.html[simple query strings] in the `q` parameter, or by specifying a http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-request-body.html[full request definition] using the http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl.html[Elasticsearch Query DSL] in the `body` parameter.
