## Interface `SpecUtilsCommonQueryParameters`

| Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `error_trace` | boolean | When set to `true` Elasticsearch will include the full stack trace of errors when they occur. |
| `filter_path` | string | string[] | Comma-separated list of filters in dot notation which reduce the response returned by Elasticsearch. |
| `human` | boolean | When set to `true` will return statistics in a format suitable for humans. For example `"exists_time": "1h"` for humans and `"eixsts_time_in_millis": 3600000` for computers. When disabled the human readable values will be omitted. This makes sense for responses being consumed only by machines. |
| `pretty` | boolean | If set to `true` the returned JSON will be "pretty-formatted". Only use this option for debugging only. |
