# `NodesIngestStats` [interface-NodesIngestStats]

| Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `count` | [long](./long.md) | Total number of documents ingested during the lifetime of this node. |
| `current` | [long](./long.md) | Total number of documents currently being ingested. |
| `failed` | [long](./long.md) | Total number of failed ingest operations during the lifetime of this node. |
| `ingested_as_first_pipeline_in_bytes` | [long](./long.md) | Total number of bytes of all documents ingested by the pipeline. This field is only present on pipelines which are the first to process a document. Thus, it is not present on pipelines which only serve as a final pipeline after a default pipeline, a pipeline run after a reroute processor, or pipelines in pipeline processors. |
| `processors` | Record<string, [NodesKeyedProcessor](./NodesKeyedProcessor.md)>[] | Total number of ingest processors. |
| `produced_as_first_pipeline_in_bytes` | [long](./long.md) | Total number of bytes of all documents produced by the pipeline. This field is only present on pipelines which are the first to process a document. Thus, it is not present on pipelines which only serve as a final pipeline after a default pipeline, a pipeline run after a reroute processor, or pipelines in pipeline processors. In situations where there are subsequent pipelines, the value represents the size of the document after all pipelines have run. |
| `time_in_millis` | [DurationValue](./DurationValue.md)<[UnitMillis](./UnitMillis.md)> | Total time, in milliseconds, spent preprocessing ingest documents during the lifetime of this node. |
