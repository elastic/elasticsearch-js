## Interface `SlmPutLifecycleRequest`

| Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `body` | string | ({ [key: string]: any; } & { policy_id?: never; master_timeout?: never; timeout?: never; config?: never; name?: never; repository?: never; retention?: never; schedule?: never; }) | All values in `body` will be added to the request body. |
| `config` | [SlmConfiguration](./SlmConfiguration.md) | Configuration for each snapshot created by the policy. |
| `master_timeout` | [Duration](./Duration.md) | The period to wait for a connection to the master node. If no response is received before the timeout expires, the request fails and returns an error. To indicate that the request should never timeout, set it to `-1`. |
| `name` | [Name](./Name.md) | Name automatically assigned to each snapshot created by the policy. Date math is supported. To prevent conflicting snapshot names, a UUID is automatically appended to each snapshot name. |
| `policy_id` | [Name](./Name.md) | The identifier for the snapshot lifecycle policy you want to create or update. |
| `querystring` | { [key: string]: any; } & { policy_id?: never; master_timeout?: never; timeout?: never; config?: never; name?: never; repository?: never; retention?: never; schedule?: never; } | All values in `querystring` will be added to the request querystring. |
| `repository` | string | Repository used to store snapshots created by this policy. This repository must exist prior to the policyâ€™s creation. You can create a repository using the snapshot repository API. |
| `retention` | [SlmRetention](./SlmRetention.md) | Retention rules used to retain and delete snapshots created by the policy. |
| `schedule` | [WatcherCronExpression](./WatcherCronExpression.md) | Periodic or absolute schedule at which the policy creates snapshots. SLM applies schedule changes immediately. |
| `timeout` | [Duration](./Duration.md) | The period to wait for a response. If no response is received before the timeout expires, the request fails and returns an error. To indicate that the request should never timeout, set it to `-1`. |
