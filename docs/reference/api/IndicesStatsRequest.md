## Interface `IndicesStatsRequest`

| Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `body` | string | ({ [key: string]: any; } & { metric?: never; index?: never; completion_fields?: never; expand_wildcards?: never; fielddata_fields?: never; fields?: never; forbid_closed_indices?: never; groups?: never; include_segment_file_sizes?: never; include_unloaded_segments?: never; level?: never; }) | All values in `body` will be added to the request body. |
| `completion_fields` | [Fields](./Fields.md) | Comma-separated list or wildcard expressions of fields to include in fielddata and suggest statistics. |
| `expand_wildcards` | [ExpandWildcards](./ExpandWildcards.md) | Type of index that wildcard patterns can match. If the request can target data streams, this argument determines whether wildcard expressions match hidden data streams. Supports comma-separated values, such as `open,hidden`. |
| `fielddata_fields` | [Fields](./Fields.md) | Comma-separated list or wildcard expressions of fields to include in fielddata statistics. |
| `fields` | [Fields](./Fields.md) | Comma-separated list or wildcard expressions of fields to include in the statistics. |
| `forbid_closed_indices` | boolean | If true, statistics are not collected from closed indices. |
| `groups` | string | string[] | Comma-separated list of search groups to include in the search statistics. |
| `include_segment_file_sizes` | boolean | If true, the call reports the aggregated disk usage of each one of the Lucene index files (only applies if segment stats are requested). |
| `include_unloaded_segments` | boolean | If true, the response includes information from segments that are not loaded into memory. |
| `index` | [Indices](./Indices.md) | A comma-separated list of index names; use `_all` or empty string to perform the operation on all indices |
| `level` | [Level](./Level.md) | Indicates whether statistics are aggregated at the cluster, index, or shard level. |
| `metric` | [Metrics](./Metrics.md) | Limit the information returned the specific metrics. |
| `querystring` | { [key: string]: any; } & { metric?: never; index?: never; completion_fields?: never; expand_wildcards?: never; fielddata_fields?: never; fields?: never; forbid_closed_indices?: never; groups?: never; include_segment_file_sizes?: never; include_unloaded_segments?: never; level?: never; } | All values in `querystring` will be added to the request querystring. |
