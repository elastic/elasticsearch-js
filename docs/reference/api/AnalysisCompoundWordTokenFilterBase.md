| Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `max_subword_size` | [integer](./integer.md) | Maximum subword character length. Longer subword tokens are excluded from the output. Defaults to `15`. |
| `min_subword_size` | [integer](./integer.md) | Minimum subword character length. Shorter subword tokens are excluded from the output. Defaults to `2`. |
| `min_word_size` | [integer](./integer.md) | Minimum word character length. Shorter word tokens are excluded from the output. Defaults to `5`. |
| `only_longest_match` | boolean | If `true`, only include the longest matching subword. Defaults to `false`. |

This path must be absolute or relative to the config location, and the file must be UTF-8 encoded. Each token in the file must be separated by a line break. Either this parameter or `word_list` must be specified. |
