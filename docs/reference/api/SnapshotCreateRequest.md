## Interface `SnapshotCreateRequest`

| Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `body` | string | ({ [key: string]: any; } & { repository?: never; snapshot?: never; master_timeout?: never; wait_for_completion?: never; expand_wildcards?: never; feature_states?: never; ignore_unavailable?: never; include_global_state?: never; indices?: never; metadata?: never; partial?: never; }) | All values in `body` will be added to the request body. |
| `expand_wildcards` | [ExpandWildcards](./ExpandWildcards.md) | Determines how wildcard patterns in the `indices` parameter match data streams and indices. It supports comma-separated values such as `open,hidden`. |
| `feature_states` | string[] | The feature states to include in the snapshot. Each feature state includes one or more system indices containing related data. You can view a list of eligible features using the get features API. If `include_global_state` is `true`, all current feature states are included by default. If `include_global_state` is `false`, no feature states are included by default. Note that specifying an empty array will result in the default behavior. To exclude all feature states, regardless of the `include_global_state` value, specify an array with only the value `none` ( `["none"]`). |
| `ignore_unavailable` | boolean | If `true`, the request ignores data streams and indices in `indices` that are missing or closed. If `false`, the request returns an error for any data stream or index that is missing or closed. |
| `include_global_state` | boolean | If `true`, the current cluster state is included in the snapshot. The cluster state includes persistent cluster settings, composable index templates, legacy index templates, ingest pipelines, and ILM policies. It also includes data stored in system indices, such as Watches and task records (configurable via `feature_states`). |
| `indices` | [Indices](./Indices.md) | A comma-separated list of data streams and indices to include in the snapshot. It supports a multi-target syntax. The default is an empty array ( `[]`), which includes all regular data streams and regular indices. To exclude all data streams and indices, use `-*`. You can't use this parameter to include or exclude system indices or system data streams from a snapshot. Use `feature_states` instead. |
| `master_timeout` | [Duration](./Duration.md) | The period to wait for a connection to the master node. If no response is received before the timeout expires, the request fails and returns an error. |
| `metadata` | [Metadata](./Metadata.md) | Arbitrary metadata to the snapshot, such as a record of who took the snapshot, why it was taken, or any other useful data. It can have any contents but it must be less than 1024 bytes. This information is not automatically generated by Elasticsearch. |
| `partial` | boolean | If `true`, it enables you to restore a partial snapshot of indices with unavailable shards. Only shards that were successfully included in the snapshot will be restored. All missing shards will be recreated as empty. If `false`, the entire restore operation will fail if one or more indices included in the snapshot do not have all primary shards available. |
| `querystring` | { [key: string]: any; } & { repository?: never; snapshot?: never; master_timeout?: never; wait_for_completion?: never; expand_wildcards?: never; feature_states?: never; ignore_unavailable?: never; include_global_state?: never; indices?: never; metadata?: never; partial?: never; } | All values in `querystring` will be added to the request querystring. |
| `repository` | [Name](./Name.md) | The name of the repository for the snapshot. |
| `snapshot` | [Name](./Name.md) | The name of the snapshot. It supportes date math. It must be unique in the repository. |
| `wait_for_completion` | boolean | If `true`, the request returns a response when the snapshot is complete. If `false`, the request returns a response when the snapshot initializes. |
