# `SecurityQueryApiKeysRequest` [interface-SecurityQueryApiKeysRequest]

| Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `aggregations` | Record<string, [SecurityQueryApiKeysApiKeyAggregationContainer](./SecurityQueryApiKeysApiKeyAggregationContainer.md)> | Any aggregations to run over the corpus of returned API keys. Aggregations and queries work together. Aggregations are computed only on the API keys that match the query. This supports only a subset of aggregation types, namely: `terms`, `range`, `date_range`, `missing`, `cardinality`, `value_count`, `composite`, `filter`, and `filters`. Additionally, aggregations only run over the same subset of fields that query works with. |
| `aggs` | Record<string, [SecurityQueryApiKeysApiKeyAggregationContainer](./SecurityQueryApiKeysApiKeyAggregationContainer.md)> | Any aggregations to run over the corpus of returned API keys. Aggregations and queries work together. Aggregations are computed only on the API keys that match the query. This supports only a subset of aggregation types, namely: `terms`, `range`, `date_range`, `missing`, `cardinality`, `value_count`, `composite`, `filter`, and `filters`. Additionally, aggregations only run over the same subset of fields that query works with. aggregations |
| `body` | string | ({ [key: string]: any; } & { with_limited_by?: never; with_profile_uid?: never; typed_keys?: never; aggregations?: never; aggs?: never; query?: never; from?: never; sort?: never; size?: never; search_after?: never; }) | All values in `body` will be added to the request body. |
| `from` | [integer](./integer.md) | The starting document offset. It must not be negative. By default, you cannot page through more than 10,000 hits using the `from` and `size` parameters. To page through more hits, use the `search_after` parameter. |
| `query` | [SecurityQueryApiKeysApiKeyQueryContainer](./SecurityQueryApiKeysApiKeyQueryContainer.md) | A query to filter which API keys to return. If the query parameter is missing, it is equivalent to a `match_all` query. The query supports a subset of query types, including `match_all`, `bool`, `term`, `terms`, `match`, `ids`, `prefix`, `wildcard`, `exists`, `range`, and `simple_query_string`. You can query the following public information associated with an API key: `id`, `type`, `name`, `creation`, `expiration`, `invalidated`, `invalidation`, `username`, `realm`, and `metadata`. NOTE: The queryable string values associated with API keys are internally mapped as keywords. Consequently, if no `analyzer` parameter is specified for a `match` query, then the provided match query string is interpreted as a single keyword value. Such a match query is hence equivalent to a `term` query. |
| `querystring` | { [key: string]: any; } & { with_limited_by?: never; with_profile_uid?: never; typed_keys?: never; aggregations?: never; aggs?: never; query?: never; from?: never; sort?: never; size?: never; search_after?: never; } | All values in `querystring` will be added to the request querystring. |
| `search_after` | [SortResults](./SortResults.md) | The search after definition. |
| `size` | [integer](./integer.md) | The number of hits to return. It must not be negative. The `size` parameter can be set to `0`, in which case no API key matches are returned, only the aggregation results. By default, you cannot page through more than 10,000 hits using the `from` and `size` parameters. To page through more hits, use the `search_after` parameter. |
| `sort` | [Sort](./Sort.md) | The sort definition. Other than `id`, all public fields of an API key are eligible for sorting. In addition, sort can also be applied to the `_doc` field to sort by index order. |
| `typed_keys` | boolean | Determines whether aggregation names are prefixed by their respective types in the response. |
| `with_limited_by` | boolean | Return the snapshot of the owner user's role descriptors associated with the API key. An API key's actual permission is the intersection of its assigned role descriptors and the owner user's role descriptors (effectively limited by it). An API key cannot retrieve any API keyâ€™s limited-by role descriptors (including itself) unless it has `manage_api_key` or higher privileges. |
| `with_profile_uid` | boolean | Determines whether to also retrieve the profile UID for the API key owner principal. If it exists, the profile UID is returned under the `profile_uid` response field for each API key. |
