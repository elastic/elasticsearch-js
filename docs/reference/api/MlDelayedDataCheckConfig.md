## Interface `MlDelayedDataCheckConfig`

| Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `check_window` | [Duration](./Duration.md) | The window of time that is searched for late data. This window of time ends with the latest finalized bucket. It defaults to null, which causes an appropriate `check_window` to be calculated when the real-time datafeed runs. In particular, the default `check_window` span calculation is based on the maximum of `2h` or `8 * bucket_span`. |
| `enabled` | boolean | Specifies whether the datafeed periodically checks for delayed data. |
