| `oversample` | [float](./float.md) | The oversampling factor to use when searching for the nearest neighbor. This is only applicable to the quantized formats: `bbq_*`, `int4_*`, and `int8_*`. When provided, `oversample * k` vectors will be gathered and then their scores will be re-computed with the original vectors. valid values are between `1.0` and `10.0` (inclusive), or `0` exactly to disable oversampling. |
