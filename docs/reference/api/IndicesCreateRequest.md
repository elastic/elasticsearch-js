## Interface `IndicesCreateRequest`

| Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `aliases` | Record<[Name](./Name.md), [IndicesAlias](./IndicesAlias.md)> | Aliases for the index. |
| `body` | string | ({ [key: string]: any; } & { index?: never; master_timeout?: never; timeout?: never; wait_for_active_shards?: never; aliases?: never; mappings?: never; settings?: never; }) | All values in `body` will be added to the request body. |
| `index` | [IndexName](./IndexName.md) | Name of the index you wish to create. Index names must meet the following criteria: * Lowercase only * Cannot include `\`, `/`, `*`, `?`, `"`, `<`, `>`, `|`, ` ` (space character), `,`, or `#` * Indices prior to 7.0 could contain a colon ( `:`), but that has been deprecated and will not be supported in later versions * Cannot start with `-`, `_`, or `+` * Cannot be `.` or `..` * Cannot be longer than 255 bytes (note thtat it is bytes, so multi-byte characters will reach the limit faster) * Names starting with `.` are deprecated, except for hidden indices and internal indices managed by plugins |
| `mappings` | [MappingTypeMapping](./MappingTypeMapping.md) | Mapping for fields in the index. If specified, this mapping can include: - Field names - Field data types - Mapping parameters |
| `master_timeout` | [Duration](./Duration.md) | Period to wait for a connection to the master node. If no response is received before the timeout expires, the request fails and returns an error. |
| `querystring` | { [key: string]: any; } & { index?: never; master_timeout?: never; timeout?: never; wait_for_active_shards?: never; aliases?: never; mappings?: never; settings?: never; } | All values in `querystring` will be added to the request querystring. |
| `settings` | [IndicesIndexSettings](./IndicesIndexSettings.md) | Configuration options for the index. |
| `timeout` | [Duration](./Duration.md) | Period to wait for a response. If no response is received before the timeout expires, the request fails and returns an error. |
| `wait_for_active_shards` | [WaitForActiveShards](./WaitForActiveShards.md) | The number of shard copies that must be active before proceeding with the operation. Set to `all` or any positive integer up to the total number of shards in the index ( `number_of_replicas+1`). |
