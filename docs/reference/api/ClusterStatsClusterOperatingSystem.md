| `allocated_processors` | [integer](./integer.md) | Number of processors used to calculate thread pool size across all selected nodes. This number can be set with the processors setting of a node and defaults to the number of processors reported by the operating system. In both cases, this number will never be larger than 32. |
| `architectures` | [ClusterStatsClusterOperatingSystemArchitecture](./ClusterStatsClusterOperatingSystemArchitecture.md)[] | Contains statistics about processor architectures (for example, x86_64 or aarch64) used by selected nodes. |
| `available_processors` | [integer](./integer.md) | Number of processors available to JVM across all selected nodes. |
| `mem` | [ClusterStatsOperatingSystemMemoryInfo](./ClusterStatsOperatingSystemMemoryInfo.md) | Contains statistics about memory used by selected nodes. |
| `names` | [ClusterStatsClusterOperatingSystemName](./ClusterStatsClusterOperatingSystemName.md)[] | Contains statistics about operating systems used by selected nodes. |
| `pretty_names` | [ClusterStatsClusterOperatingSystemPrettyName](./ClusterStatsClusterOperatingSystemPrettyName.md)[] | Contains statistics about operating systems used by selected nodes. |
