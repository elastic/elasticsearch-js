## Interface `MlEstimateModelMemoryRequest`

| Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `analysis_config` | [MlAnalysisConfig](./MlAnalysisConfig.md) | For a list of the properties that you can specify in the `analysis_config` component of the body of this API. |
| `body` | string | ({ [key: string]: any; } & { analysis_config?: never; max_bucket_cardinality?: never; overall_cardinality?: never; }) | All values in `body` will be added to the request body. |
| `max_bucket_cardinality` | Record<[Field](./Field.md), [long](./long.md)> | Estimates of the highest cardinality in a single bucket that is observed for influencer fields over the time period that the job analyzes data. To produce a good answer, values must be provided for all influencer fields. Providing values for fields that are not listed as `influencers` has no effect on the estimation. |
| `overall_cardinality` | Record<[Field](./Field.md), [long](./long.md)> | Estimates of the cardinality that is observed for fields over the whole time period that the job analyzes data. To produce a good answer, values must be provided for fields referenced in the `by_field_name`, `over_field_name` and `partition_field_name` of any detectors. Providing values for other fields has no effect on the estimation. It can be omitted from the request if no detectors have a `by_field_name`, `over_field_name` or `partition_field_name`. |
| `querystring` | { [key: string]: any; } & { analysis_config?: never; max_bucket_cardinality?: never; overall_cardinality?: never; } | All values in `querystring` will be added to the request querystring. |
