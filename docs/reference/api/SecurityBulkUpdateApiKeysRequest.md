# `SecurityBulkUpdateApiKeysRequest` [interface-SecurityBulkUpdateApiKeysRequest]

| Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `body` | string | ({ [key: string]: any; } & { expiration?: never; ids?: never; metadata?: never; role_descriptors?: never; }) | All values in `body` will be added to the request body. |
| `expiration` | [Duration](./Duration.md) | Expiration time for the API keys. By default, API keys never expire. This property can be omitted to leave the value unchanged. |
| `ids` | string | string[] | The API key identifiers. |
| `metadata` | [Metadata](./Metadata.md) | Arbitrary nested metadata to associate with the API keys. Within the `metadata` object, top-level keys beginning with an underscore ( `_`) are reserved for system usage. Any information specified with this parameter fully replaces metadata previously associated with the API key. |
| `querystring` | { [key: string]: any; } & { expiration?: never; ids?: never; metadata?: never; role_descriptors?: never; } | All values in `querystring` will be added to the request querystring. |
| `role_descriptors` | Record<string, [SecurityRoleDescriptor](./SecurityRoleDescriptor.md)> | The role descriptors to assign to the API keys. An API key's effective permissions are an intersection of its assigned privileges and the point-in-time snapshot of permissions of the owner user. You can assign new privileges by specifying them in this parameter. To remove assigned privileges, supply the `role_descriptors` parameter as an empty object `{}`. If an API key has no assigned privileges, it inherits the owner user's full permissions. The snapshot of the owner's permissions is always updated, whether you supply the `role_descriptors` parameter. The structure of a role descriptor is the same as the request for the create API keys API. |
