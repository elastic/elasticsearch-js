## Interface `AnalysisWordDelimiterTokenFilterBase`

| Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `catenate_all` | boolean | If `true`, the filter produces catenated tokens for chains of alphanumeric characters separated by non-alphabetic delimiters. Defaults to `false`. |
| `catenate_numbers` | boolean | If `true`, the filter produces catenated tokens for chains of numeric characters separated by non-alphabetic delimiters. Defaults to `false`. |
| `catenate_words` | boolean | If `true`, the filter produces catenated tokens for chains of alphabetical characters separated by non-alphabetic delimiters. Defaults to `false`. |
| `generate_number_parts` | boolean | If `true`, the filter includes tokens consisting of only numeric characters in the output. If `false`, the filter excludes these tokens from the output. Defaults to `true`. |
| `generate_word_parts` | boolean | If `true`, the filter includes tokens consisting of only alphabetical characters in the output. If `false`, the filter excludes these tokens from the output. Defaults to `true`. |
| `preserve_original` | [SpecUtilsStringified](./SpecUtilsStringified.md)<boolean> | If `true`, the filter includes the original version of any split tokens in the output. This original version includes non-alphanumeric delimiters. Defaults to `false`. |
| `protected_words_path` | string | Path to a file that contains a list of tokens the filter won’t split. This path must be absolute or relative to the `config` location, and the file must be UTF-8 encoded. Each token in the file must be separated by a line break. |
| `protected_words` | string[] | Array of tokens the filter won’t split. |
| `split_on_case_change` | boolean | If `true`, the filter splits tokens at letter case transitions. For example: camelCase - > [ camel, Case ]. Defaults to `true`. |
| `split_on_numerics` | boolean | If `true`, the filter splits tokens at letter-number transitions. For example: j2se - > [ j, 2, se ]. Defaults to `true`. |
| `stem_english_possessive` | boolean | If `true`, the filter removes the English possessive ( `'s`) from the end of each token. For example: O'Neil's - > [ O, Neil ]. Defaults to `true`. |
| `type_table_path` | string | Path to a file that contains custom type mappings for characters. This allows you to map non-alphanumeric characters as numeric or alphanumeric to avoid splitting on those characters. |
| `type_table` | string[] | Array of custom type mappings for characters. This allows you to map non-alphanumeric characters as numeric or alphanumeric to avoid splitting on those characters. |
