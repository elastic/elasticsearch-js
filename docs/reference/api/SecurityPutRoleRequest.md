## Interface `SecurityPutRoleRequest`

| Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `applications` | [SecurityApplicationPrivileges](./SecurityApplicationPrivileges.md)[] | A list of application privilege entries. |
| `body` | string | ({ [key: string]: any; } & { name?: never; refresh?: never; applications?: never; cluster?: never; global?: never; indices?: never; remote_indices?: never; remote_cluster?: never; metadata?: never; run_as?: never; description?: never; transient_metadata?: never; }) | All values in `body` will be added to the request body. |
| `cluster` | [SecurityClusterPrivilege](./SecurityClusterPrivilege.md)[] | A list of cluster privileges. These privileges define the cluster-level actions for users with this role. |
| `description` | string | Optional description of the role descriptor |
| `global` | Record<string, any> | An object defining global privileges. A global privilege is a form of cluster privilege that is request-aware. Support for global privileges is currently limited to the management of application privileges. |
| `indices` | [SecurityIndicesPrivileges](./SecurityIndicesPrivileges.md)[] | A list of indices permissions entries. |
| `metadata` | [Metadata](./Metadata.md) | Optional metadata. Within the metadata object, keys that begin with an underscore ( `_`) are reserved for system use. |
| `name` | [Name](./Name.md) | The name of the role that is being created or updated. On Elasticsearch Serverless, the role name must begin with a letter or digit and can only contain letters, digits and the characters '_', '-', and '.'. Each role must have a unique name, as this will serve as the identifier for that role. |
| `querystring` | { [key: string]: any; } & { name?: never; refresh?: never; applications?: never; cluster?: never; global?: never; indices?: never; remote_indices?: never; remote_cluster?: never; metadata?: never; run_as?: never; description?: never; transient_metadata?: never; } | All values in `querystring` will be added to the request querystring. |
| `refresh` | [Refresh](./Refresh.md) | If `true` (the default) then refresh the affected shards to make this operation visible to search, if `wait_for` then wait for a refresh to make this operation visible to search, if `false` then do nothing with refreshes. |
| `remote_cluster` | [SecurityRemoteClusterPrivileges](./SecurityRemoteClusterPrivileges.md)[] | A list of remote cluster permissions entries. |
| `remote_indices` | [SecurityRemoteIndicesPrivileges](./SecurityRemoteIndicesPrivileges.md)[] | A list of remote indices permissions entries. NOTE: Remote indices are effective for remote clusters configured with the API key based model. They have no effect for remote clusters configured with the certificate based model. |
| `run_as` | string[] | A list of users that the owners of this role can impersonate. *Note*: in Serverless, the run-as feature is disabled. For API compatibility, you can still specify an empty `run_as` field, but a non-empty list will be rejected. |
| `transient_metadata` | Record<string, any> | Indicates roles that might be incompatible with the current cluster license, specifically roles with document and field level security. When the cluster license doesnâ€™t allow certain features for a given role, this parameter is updated dynamically to list the incompatible features. If `enabled` is `false`, the role is ignored, but is still listed in the response from the authenticate API. |
