| `count` | [integer](./integer.md) | The number of roles returned in the response. |
| `roles` | [SecurityQueryRoleQueryRole](./SecurityQueryRoleQueryRole.md)[] | A list of roles that match the query. The returned role format is an extension of the role definition format. It adds the `transient_metadata.enabled` and the `_sort` fields. `transient_metadata.enabled` is set to `false` in case the role is automatically disabled, for example when the role grants privileges that are not allowed by the installed license. `_sort` is present when the search query sorts on some field. It contains the array of values that have been used for sorting. |
| `total` | [integer](./integer.md) | The total number of roles found. |
