| Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `body` | string | ({ [key: string]: any; } & { name?: never; refresh?: never; enabled?: never; metadata?: never; roles?: never; role_templates?: never; rules?: never; run_as?: never; }) | All values in `body` will be added to the request body. |
| `enabled` | boolean | Mappings that have `enabled` set to `false` are ignored when role mapping is performed. |
| `metadata` | [Metadata](./Metadata.md) | Additional metadata that helps define which roles are assigned to each user. Within the metadata object, keys beginning with `_` are reserved for system usage. |
| `name` | [Name](./Name.md) | The distinct name that identifies the role mapping. The name is used solely as an identifier to facilitate interaction via the API; it does not affect the behavior of the mapping in any way. |
| `querystring` | { [key: string]: any; } & { name?: never; refresh?: never; enabled?: never; metadata?: never; roles?: never; role_templates?: never; rules?: never; run_as?: never; } | All values in `querystring` will be added to the request querystring. |
| `refresh` | [Refresh](./Refresh.md) | If `true` (the default) then refresh the affected shards to make this operation visible to search, if `wait_for` then wait for a refresh to make this operation visible to search, if `false` then do nothing with refreshes. |
| `role_templates` | [SecurityRoleTemplate](./SecurityRoleTemplate.md)[] | A list of Mustache templates that will be evaluated to determine the roles names that should granted to the users that match the role mapping rules. Exactly one of `roles` or `role_templates` must be specified. |
| `roles` | string[] | A list of role names that are granted to the users that match the role mapping rules. Exactly one of `roles` or `role_templates` must be specified. |
| `rules` | [SecurityRoleMappingRule](./SecurityRoleMappingRule.md) | The rules that determine which users should be matched by the mapping. A rule is a logical condition that is expressed by using a JSON DSL. |
| `run_as` | string[] | &nbsp; |
