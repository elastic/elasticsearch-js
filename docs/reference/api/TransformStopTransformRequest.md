# `TransformStopTransformRequest` [interface-TransformStopTransformRequest]

| Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `allow_no_match` | boolean | Specifies what to do when the request: contains wildcard expressions and there are no transforms that match; contains the `_all` string or no identifiers and there are no matches; contains wildcard expressions and there are only partial matches. If it is true, the API returns a successful acknowledgement message when there are no matches. When there are only partial matches, the API stops the appropriate transforms. If it is false, the request returns a 404 status code when there are no matches or only partial matches. |
| `body` | string | ({ [key: string]: any; } & { transform_id?: never; allow_no_match?: never; force?: never; timeout?: never; wait_for_checkpoint?: never; wait_for_completion?: never; }) | All values in `body` will be added to the request body. |
| `force` | boolean | If it is true, the API forcefully stops the transforms. |
| `querystring` | { [key: string]: any; } & { transform_id?: never; allow_no_match?: never; force?: never; timeout?: never; wait_for_checkpoint?: never; wait_for_completion?: never; } | All values in `querystring` will be added to the request querystring. |
| `timeout` | [Duration](./Duration.md) | Period to wait for a response when `wait_for_completion` is `true`. If no response is received before the timeout expires, the request returns a timeout exception. However, the request continues processing and eventually moves the transform to a STOPPED state. |
| `transform_id` | [Name](./Name.md) | Identifier for the transform. To stop multiple transforms, use a comma-separated list or a wildcard expression. To stop all transforms, use `_all` or `*` as the identifier. |
| `wait_for_checkpoint` | boolean | If it is true, the transform does not completely stop until the current checkpoint is completed. If it is false, the transform stops as soon as possible. |
| `wait_for_completion` | boolean | If it is true, the API blocks until the indexer state completely stops. If it is false, the API returns immediately and the indexer is stopped asynchronously in the background. |
