| `ignore_missing` | boolean | If `true` and `field` does not exist, the processor quietly exits without modifying the document. |
| `shape_type` | [IngestShapeType](./IngestShapeType.md) | Which field mapping type is to be used when processing the circle: `geo_shape` or `shape`. |
| `target_field` | [Field](./Field.md) | The field to assign the polygon shape to By default, the field is updated in-place. |
