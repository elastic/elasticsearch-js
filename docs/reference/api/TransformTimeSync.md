| `delay` | [Duration](./Duration.md) | The time delay between the current time and the latest input data time. |
| `field` | [Field](./Field.md) | The date field that is used to identify new documents in the source. In general, itâ€™s a good idea to use a field that contains the ingest timestamp. If you use a different field, you might need to set the delay such that it accounts for data transmission delays. |
