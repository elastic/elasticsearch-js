# `SearchTermSuggester` [interface-SearchTermSuggester]

| Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `lowercase_terms` | boolean | &nbsp; |
| `max_edits` | [integer](./integer.md) | The maximum edit distance candidate suggestions can have in order to be considered as a suggestion. Can only be `1` or `2`. |
| `max_inspections` | [integer](./integer.md) | A factor that is used to multiply with the shard_size in order to inspect more candidate spelling corrections on the shard level. Can improve accuracy at the cost of performance. |
| `max_term_freq` | [float](./float.md) | The maximum threshold in number of documents in which a suggest text token can exist in order to be included. Can be a relative percentage number (for example `0.4`) or an absolute number to represent document frequencies. If a value higher than 1 is specified, then fractional can not be specified. |
| `min_doc_freq` | [float](./float.md) | The minimal threshold in number of documents a suggestion should appear in. This can improve quality by only suggesting high frequency terms. Can be specified as an absolute number or as a relative percentage of number of documents. If a value higher than 1 is specified, then the number cannot be fractional. |
| `min_word_length` | [integer](./integer.md) | The minimum length a suggest text term must have in order to be included. |
| `prefix_length` | [integer](./integer.md) | The number of minimal prefix characters that must match in order be a candidate for suggestions. Increasing this number improves spellcheck performance. |
| `shard_size` | [integer](./integer.md) | Sets the maximum number of suggestions to be retrieved from each individual shard. |
| `sort` | [SearchSuggestSort](./SearchSuggestSort.md) | Defines how suggestions should be sorted per suggest text term. |
| `string_distance` | [SearchStringDistance](./SearchStringDistance.md) | The string distance implementation to use for comparing how similar suggested terms are. |
| `suggest_mode` | [SuggestMode](./SuggestMode.md) | Controls what suggestions are included or controls for what suggest text terms, suggestions should be suggested. |
| `text` | string | The suggest text. Needs to be set globally or per suggestion. |
