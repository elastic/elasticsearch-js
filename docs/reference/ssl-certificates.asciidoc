[[client.ssl.certificates]]
== client.ssl.certificates

Get SSL certificates. Get information about the X.509 certificates that are used to encrypt communications in the cluster. The API returns a list that includes certificates from all TLS contexts including: - Settings for transport and HTTP interfaces - TLS settings that are used within authentication realms - TLS settings for remote monitoring exporters The list includes certificates that are used for configuring trust, such as those configured in the `xpack.security.transport.ssl.truststore` and `xpack.security.transport.ssl.certificate_authorities` settings. It also includes certificates that are used for configuring server identity, such as `xpack.security.http.ssl.keystore` and `xpack.security.http.ssl.certificate settings`. The list does not include certificates that are sourced from the default SSL context of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), even if those certificates are in use within Elasticsearch. NOTE: When a PKCS#11 token is configured as the truststore of the JRE, the API returns all the certificates that are included in the PKCS#11 token irrespective of whether these are used in the Elasticsearch TLS configuration. If Elasticsearch is configured to use a keystore or truststore, the API output includes all certificates in that store, even though some of the certificates might not be in active use within the cluster.
