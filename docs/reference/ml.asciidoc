[[client.ml.clearTrainedModelDeploymentCache]]
== `client.ml.clearTrainedModelDeploymentCache()`

Clear trained model deployment cache. Cache will be cleared on all nodes where the trained model is assigned. A trained model deployment may have an inference cache enabled. As requests are handled by each allocated node, their responses may be cached on that individual node. Calling this API clears the caches without restarting the deployment.

[[client.ml.closeJob]]
== `client.ml.closeJob()`

Close anomaly detection jobs. A job can be opened and closed multiple times throughout its lifecycle. A closed job cannot receive data or perform analysis operations, but you can still explore and navigate results. When you close a job, it runs housekeeping tasks such as pruning the model history, flushing buffers, calculating final results and persisting the model snapshots. Depending upon the size of the job, it could take several minutes to close and the equivalent time to re-open. After it is closed, the job has a minimal overhead on the cluster except for maintaining its meta data. Therefore it is a best practice to close jobs that are no longer required to process data. If you close an anomaly detection job whose datafeed is running, the request first tries to stop the datafeed. This behavior is equivalent to calling stop datafeed API with the same timeout and force parameters as the close job request. When a datafeed that has a specified end date stops, it automatically closes its associated job.

[[client.ml.flushJob]]
== `client.ml.flushJob()`

Force buffered data to be processed. The flush jobs API is only applicable when sending data for analysis using the post data API. Depending on the content of the buffer, then it might additionally calculate new results. Both flush and close operations are similar, however the flush is more efficient if you are expecting to send more data for analysis. When flushing, the job remains open and is available to continue analyzing data. A close operation additionally prunes and persists the model state to disk and the job must be opened again before analyzing further data.

[[client.ml.getOverallBuckets]]
== `client.ml.getOverallBuckets()`

Get overall bucket results. Retrievs overall bucket results that summarize the bucket results of multiple anomaly detection jobs. The `overall_score` is calculated by combining the scores of all the buckets within the overall bucket span. First, the maximum `anomaly_score` per anomaly detection job in the overall bucket is calculated. Then the `top_n` of those scores are averaged to result in the `overall_score`. This means that you can fine-tune the `overall_score` so that it is more or less sensitive to the number of jobs that detect an anomaly at the same time. For example, if you set `top_n` to `1`, the `overall_score` is the maximum bucket score in the overall bucket. Alternatively, if you set `top_n` to the number of jobs, the `overall_score` is high only when all jobs detect anomalies in that overall bucket. If you set the `bucket_span` parameter (to a value greater than its default), the `overall_score` is the maximum `overall_score` of the overall buckets that have a span equal to the jobs' largest bucket span.

[[client.ml.getRecords]]
== `client.ml.getRecords()`

Get anomaly records for an anomaly detection job. Records contain the detailed analytical results. They describe the anomalous activity that has been identified in the input data based on the detector configuration. There can be many anomaly records depending on the characteristics and size of the input data. In practice, there are often too many to be able to manually process them. The machine learning features therefore perform a sophisticated aggregation of the anomaly records into buckets. The number of record results depends on the number of anomalies found in each bucket, which relates to the number of time series being modeled and the number of detectors.

[[client.ml.putDatafeed]]

Create a datafeed. Datafeeds retrieve data from Elasticsearch for analysis by an anomaly detection job. You can associate only one datafeed with each anomaly detection job. The datafeed contains a query that runs at a defined interval (`frequency`). If you are concerned about delayed data, you can add a delay (`query_delay') at each interval. When Elasticsearch security features are enabled, your datafeed remembers which roles the user who created it had at the time of creation and runs the query using those same roles. If you provide secondary authorization headers, those credentials are used instead. You must use Kibana, this API, or the create anomaly detection jobs API to create a datafeed. Do not add a datafeed directly to the `.ml-config` index. Do not give users `write` privileges on the `.ml-config` index.

[[client.ml.putTrainedModelAlias]]
== `client.ml.putTrainedModelAlias()`

Create or update a trained model alias. A trained model alias is a logical name used to reference a single trained model. You can use aliases instead of trained model identifiers to make it easier to reference your models. For example, you can use aliases in inference aggregations and processors. An alias must be unique and refer to only a single trained model. However, you can have multiple aliases for each trained model. If you use this API to update an alias such that it references a different trained model ID and the model uses a different type of data frame analytics, an error occurs. For example, this situation occurs if you have a trained model for regression analysis and a trained model for classification analysis; you cannot reassign an alias from one type of trained model to another. If you use this API to update an alias and there are very few input fields in common between the old and new trained models for the model alias, the API returns a warning.

[[client.ml.revertModelSnapshot]]
== `client.ml.revertModelSnapshot()`

Revert to a snapshot. The machine learning features react quickly to anomalous input, learning new behaviors in data. Highly anomalous input increases the variance in the models whilst the system learns whether this is a new step-change in behavior or a one-off event. In the case where this anomalous input is known to be a one-off, then it might be appropriate to reset the model state to a time before this event. For example, you might consider reverting to a saved snapshot after Black Friday or a critical system failure.

== `client.ml.setUpgradeMode()`

Set upgrade_mode for ML indices. Sets a cluster wide upgrade_mode setting that prepares machine learning indices for an upgrade. When upgrading your cluster, in some circumstances you must restart your nodes and reindex your machine learning indices. In those circumstances, there must be no machine learning jobs running. You can close the machine learning jobs, do the upgrade, then open all the jobs again. Alternatively, you can use this API to temporarily halt tasks associated with the jobs and datafeeds and prevent new jobs from opening. You can also use this API during upgrades that do not require you to reindex your machine learning indices, though stopping jobs is not a requirement in that case. You can see the current value for the upgrade_mode setting by using the get machine learning info API.

[[client.ml.startDataFrameAnalytics]]
== `client.ml.startDataFrameAnalytics()`

Start a data frame analytics job. A data frame analytics job can be started and stopped multiple times throughout its lifecycle. If the destination index does not exist, it is created automatically the first time you start the data frame analytics job. The `index.number_of_shards` and `index.number_of_replicas` settings for the destination index are copied from the source index. If there are multiple source indices, the destination index copies the highest setting values. The mappings for the destination index are also copied from the source indices. If there are any mapping conflicts, the job fails to start. If the destination index exists, it is used as is. You can therefore set up the destination index in advance with custom settings and mappings.

[[client.ml.startDatafeed]]
== `client.ml.startDatafeed()`

Start datafeeds. A datafeed must be started in order to retrieve data from Elasticsearch. A datafeed can be started and stopped multiple times throughout its lifecycle. Before you can start a datafeed, the anomaly detection job must be open. Otherwise, an error occurs. If you restart a stopped datafeed, it continues processing input data from the next millisecond after it was stopped. If new data was indexed for that exact millisecond between stopping and starting, it will be ignored. When Elasticsearch security features are enabled, your datafeed remembers which roles the last user to create or update it had at the time of creation or update and runs the query using those same roles. If you provided secondary authorization headers when you created or updated the datafeed, those credentials are used instead.
