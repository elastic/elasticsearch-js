# IngestPipeline

## Interface

### Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `description?` | `string` | Description of the ingest pipeline. |
| `on_failure?` | `IngestProcessorContainer[]` | Processors to run immediately after a processor failure. |
| `processors?` | `IngestProcessorContainer[]` | Processors used to perform transformations on documents before indexing.
Processors run sequentially in the order specified. |
| `version?` | [`VersionNumber`](VersionNumber.md) | Version number used by external systems to track ingest pipelines. |
| `deprecated?` | `boolean` | Marks this ingest pipeline as deprecated.
When a deprecated ingest pipeline is referenced as the default or final pipeline when creating or updating a non-deprecated index template, Elasticsearch will emit a deprecation warning. |
| `_meta?` | [`Metadata`](Metadata.md) | Arbitrary metadata about the ingest pipeline. This map is not automatically generated by Elasticsearch. |
| `created_date?` | [`DateTime`](DateTime.md) | Date and time when the pipeline was created. Only returned if the `human` query parameter is `true`. |
| `created_date_millis?` | `EpochTime<UnitMillis>` | Date and time when the pipeline was created, in milliseconds since the epoch. |
| `modified_date?` | [`DateTime`](DateTime.md) | Date and time when the pipeline was last modified. Only returned if the `human` query parameter is `true`. |
| `modified_date_millis?` | `EpochTime<UnitMillis>` | Date and time when the pipeline was last modified, in milliseconds since the epoch. |
| `field_access_pattern?` | [`IngestFieldAccessPattern`](IngestFieldAccessPattern.md) | Controls how processors in this pipeline should read and write data on a document's source. |
