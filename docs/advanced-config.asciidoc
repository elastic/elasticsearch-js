=== Advanced configuration

If you need to customize the client behavior heavily, you are in the right 
place! The client enables you to customize the following internals:

* `Transport` class
* `ConnectionPool` class
* `Connection` class
* `Serializer` class


[discrete]
==== `Transport`

This class is responsible for performing the request to {es} and handling 
errors, it also handles the sniffing.

[source,js]
----
const { Client, Transport } = require('@elastic/elasticsearch')

class MyTransport extends Transport {
  request (params, options, callback) {
    // your code
  }
}

const client = new Client({
    Transport: MyTransport
})
----

Sometimes you need to inject a small snippet of your code and then continue to 
use the usual client code. In such cases, call `super.method`:

[source,js]
----
class MyTransport extends Transport {
  request (params, options, callback) {
    // your code
    return super.request(params, options, callback)
  }
}
----


[discrete]
==== `ConnectionPool`

This class is responsible for keeping in memory all the {es} Connection that you 
are using. There is a single Connection for every node. The connection pool 
handles the resurrection strategies and the updates of the pool.

[source,js]
----
const { Client, ConnectionPool } = require('@elastic/elasticsearch')

class MyConnectionPool extends ConnectionPool {
  markAlive (connection) {
    // your code
    super.markAlive(connection)
  }
}

const client = new Client({
    ConnectionPool: MyConnectionPool
})
----


[discrete]
==== `Connection`

This class represents a single node, it holds every information we have on the 
node, such as roles, id, URL, custom headers and so on. The actual HTTP request 
is performed here, this means that if you want to swap the default HTTP client 
(Node.js core), you should override the `request` method of this class.

[source,js]
----
const { Client, Connection } = require('@elastic/elasticsearch')

class MyConnection extends Connection {
  request (params, callback) {
    // your code
  }
}

const client = new Client({
  Connection: MyConnection
})
----


[discrete]
==== `Serializer`

This class is responsible for the serialization of every request, it offers the 
following methods:

* `serialize(object: any): string;` serializes request objects.
* `deserialize(json: string): any;` deserializes response strings.
* `ndserialize(array: any[]): string;` serializes bulk request objects.
* `qserialize(object: any): string;` serializes request query parameters.

[source,js]
----
const { Client, Serializer } = require('@elastic/elasticsearch')

class MySerializer extends Serializer {
  serialize (object) {
    // your code
  }
}

const client = new Client({
  Serializer: MySerializer
})
----

[discrete]
[[deserialization]]
==== Deserialization

By default, the deserialization is done with https://github.com/fastify/secure-json-parse[`secure-json-parse`]
instead of JSON.parse to protect you against https://web.archive.org/web/20200319091159/https://hueniverse.com/square-brackets-are-the-enemy-ff5b9fd8a3e8?gi=184a27ee2a08[prototype poisoning] attacks better.
In most cases, you donâ€™t need to care about this, but if the object stored in Elasticsearch
contains either the `__proto__` or `constructor` keys, the deserialization phase will throw an exception.

If you want to opt-out from this behavior, you should override the default serializer class as follows:

[source,js]
----
// We still recommend to use the `secure-json-parse` library
// and configure it to allow the keys you need to use.
const sjson = require('secure-json-parse')
const { Client, Serializer, errors } = require('@elastic/elasticsearch')

class InsecureSerializer extends Serializer {
  deserialize (json) {
    let object
    try {
      object = sjson.parse(json, { constructorAction: 'ignore' })
    } catch (err) {
      throw new errors.DeserializationError(err.message, json)
    }
    return object
  }
}

const client = new Client({
  node: 'http://localhost:9200',
  Serializer: InsecureSerializer
})
