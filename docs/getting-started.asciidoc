== Getting started

This page guides you through the installation process of the Node.js client,
shows you how to instantiate the client, and how to perform basic Elasticsearch 
operations with it.

[discrete]
=== Requirements

* https://nodejs.org/[Node.js] version 14.x or newer
* https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm[`npm`], usually bundled with Node.js

[discrete]
=== Installation 

To install the latest version of the client, run the following command:

[source,shell]
--------------------------
npm install @elastic/elasticsearch
--------------------------

Refer to the <<installation>> page to learn more.


[discrete]
=== Connecting

You can connect to the Elastic Cloud using an API key and the Elasticsearch 
endpoint. 

[source,js]
----
const { Client } = require('@elastic/elasticsearch')
const client = new Client({
  node: 'https://...', // Elasticsearch endpoint
  auth: {
    apiKey: 'abc123' // base64-encoded key
  }
})
----

Your Elasticsearch endpoint can be found on the **My deployment** page of your 
deployment:

You can generate an API key on the **Management** page under Security.

For other connection options, refer to the <<client-connecting>> section.

=== Operations

Time to use Elasticsearch! This section walks you through the basic, and most 
important, operations of Elasticsearch.


[discrete]
==== Creating an index

This is how you create the `my_index` index:

[source,js]
----
await client.indices.create({ index: 'my_index' })
----


[discrete]
==== Indexing documents

This is a simple way of indexing a document:

[source,js]
----
await client.index({
  index: 'my_index',
  id: 'my_document_id',
  document: {
    foo: 'foo',
    bar: 'bar',
  },
})
----


[discrete]
==== Getting documents

You can get documents by using the following code:

[source,js]
----
await client.get({
  index: 'my_index',
  id: 'my_document_id',
})
----


[discrete]
==== Searching documents

This is how you can create a single match query with the client: 

[source,js]
----
await client.search({
  query: {
    match: {
      foo: 'foo'
    }
  }
})
----


[discrete]
==== Updating documents

This is how you can update a document, for example to add a new field:

[source,js]
----
await client.update({
  index: 'my_index',
  id: 'my_document_id',
  doc: {
    foo: 'bar',
    new_field: 'new value'
  }
})
----


[discrete]
==== Deleting documents

[source,js]
----
await client.delete({
  index: 'my_index',
  id: 'my_document_id',
})
----


[discrete]
==== Deleting an index

[source,js]
----
await client.indices.delete({ index: 'my_index' })
----
