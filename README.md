## Supported Elasticsearch Versions

[Jenkins](https://build.elasticsearch.org/job/es-js_nightly/)

Elasticsearch.js provides support for, and is regularly tested against, Elasticsearch releases **0.90.5 and greater**. We also test against the latest changes in the 0.90 and master branches of the Elasticsearch repository. To tell the client which version of Elastisearch you are using, and therefore the API it should provide, set the `apiVerson` config param. [More info](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/configuration.html#_config_options)

## Examples

Create a client instance
```js
var elasticsearch = require('elasticsearch');
var client = new elasticsearch.Client({
  host: 'localhost:9200',
  log: 'trace'
});
```

Send a HEAD request to `/?hello=elasticsearch` and allow up to 1 second for it to complete.
```js
client.ping({
  // ping usually has a 100ms timeout
  requestTimeout: 1000,

  // undocumented params are appended to the query string
  hello: "elasticsearch!"
}, function (error) {
  if (error) {
    console.trace('elasticsearch cluster is down!');
  } else {
    console.log('All is well');
  }
});
```

Skip the callback to get a promise back
```js
client.search({
  q: 'pants'
}).then(function (body) {
  var hits = body.hits.hits;
}, function (error) {
  console.trace(error.message);
});
```

Find tweets that have "elasticsearch" in their body field
```js
client.search({
  index: 'twitter',
  type: 'tweets',
  body: {
    query: {
      match: {
        body: 'elasticsearch'
      }
    }
  }
}).then(function (resp) {
    var hits = resp.hits.hits;
}, function (err) {
    console.trace(err.message);
});
```
